# Random Number Display
## How it should work
Before the randomized numbers start to appear, the user can enter settings
* Number range to appear on screen: 1 - 5 by default
* Range for the length of time that each number appears on the screen
* Future iteration - make it so the user can select specific numbers they want to appear i.e. only 1 or 5 vs. all numbers from 1 - 5
